# Rational (DEPRECATED)

⚠️ **This module is deprecated. Use `@rational` in module `moonbitlang/x` instead. Note that you need to rename `Rational` to `Rational64`.**

The `Rational` type represents a rational number, which is a number that can be expressed as a fraction `a/b` where `a` and `b` are integers and `b` is not zero.

All tests and examples have been removed. Please refer to the new `moonbitlang/x` module for updated [documentation](https://mooncakes.io/docs/moonbitlang/x/rational) and examples.
