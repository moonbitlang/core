**API Notes**
- Int16 exposes the expected numeric surface: constants, magnitude helper, bit reinterpretation, and standard arithmetic/bitwise trait impls; feels consistent with other core numeric packages.
- Trait coverage looks complete for general arithmetic use, including hashing and JSON encoding.

**Potential Issues**
- `Int16::abs` cannot represent `abs(min_value)` in two’s complement and likely returns the unchanged `min_value`; that silent edge case should be documented or handled explicitly.
- `reinterpret_as_uint16` suggests a bit-cast but the behavior (endian assumptions, preservation of negative values) isn’t spelled out; ambiguity here can lead to misuse.

**Suggestions**
1. Document `abs`’s behavior on `min_value`, or return an option/error to avoid silent overflow.
2. Clarify that `reinterpret_as_uint16` is a bit reinterpretation (not numeric conversion) and note any constraints.
3. Consider adding a conventional widening/narrowing conversion API (`to_uint16` / `from_uint16`) if reinterpretation isn’t meant to serve that role.
