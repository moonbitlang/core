- **API Outlook**: Interface currently exports only trait impls (`Show`, `ToJson`) for `Error`; no values, constructors, or documented type definition appear, so practical surface for consumers is opaque.
- **Potential Issues**: Missing `Error` declaration in the interface suggests the type might not be publicly constructible or inspectable; if the type is meant to be used externally, callers can see it but cannot create or pattern-match it. Lack of exposed helpers leaves trait impls largely unusable.
- **Suggestions**: 1) Expose the `Error` type definition or at least public constructors/wrappers so clients can produce errors. 2) Consider adding factory functions or constants for common error cases to make the package useful. 3) Document intended usage of `Error` so trait impls have clear context.
