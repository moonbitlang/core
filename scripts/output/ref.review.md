**Potential Issues**
- `ref/pkg.generated.mbti:8` – `Ref::protect(Self[T], T, () -> R raise?) -> R raise?` is hard to parse without docs; the extra `T` parameter (presumably a default/reset value) is non-obvious and duplicating the current value by copy may be surprising for consumers.
- `ref/pkg.generated.mbti:5` – Exposing both `fn[T] new(T) -> Ref[T]` and `Ref::new` looks redundant; unless there’s a convention-driven need for the free function, it risks API surface bloat.

**Assessment**
- Overall the API is small and focused on mutable reference utilities with functional-style helpers (`map`, `update`, `swap`), which reads clean and generic-friendly.
- The use of `raise?` on the higher-order helpers is consistent, signalling that user callbacks may raise, and the `quickcheck.Arbitrary` instance is a nice integration touch.

**Suggestions**
1. Clarify or rethink `Ref::protect`: if the second `T` argument is essential, consider renaming/adding docs or refactoring to an explicit helper so its intent isn’t ambiguous.
2. Decide whether both `new` entry points are needed; if not, consolidate on either the free function or the associated function to simplify the API.
