Solid selection of conversions and logic helpers; the public surface in `uint16/pkg.generated.mbti:1` feels cohesive and covers the expected arithmetic/bit traits plus JSON support.  

Potential issues  
- `UInt16::reinterpret_as_int16` (`uint16/pkg.generated.mbti:11`) exposes a lossy reinterpretation with no safe alternative; the name implies “bit cast”, yet the result is signed and may surprise callers with negative values.  
- The surrogate helpers (`uint16/pkg.generated.mbti:7-9`) imply UTF-16 awareness, but there’s no complementary constructor (e.g., from `Char`) or documentation hint, so consumers may struggle to use them correctly.  
- Only `unsafe_to_char` (`uint16/pkg.generated.mbti:15`) throws on invalid values; lacking an intermediate `expect_*`-style helper or explicit error type may lead to panics in user code.

Suggestions  
1. Rename `reinterpret_as_int16` (e.g., `to_int16_wrapping`) or add a checked `to_int16()` that returns an option/result to clarify intent.  
2. Introduce a `from_char(Char) -> UInt16` (and possibly surrogate-specific constants) to round out the Unicode helpers.  
3. Consider documenting or encoding failure modes for `unsafe_to_char`, either via a safe wrapper or by signalling the panic contract in the interface docs.
