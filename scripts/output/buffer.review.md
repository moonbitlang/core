# Review: moonbitlang/core/buffer

**File:** `buffer/pkg.generated.mbti`  
**Date:** 2025-10-09T09:56:50.236Z  
**Status:** âœ“ Success

---

**Findings**
- `buffer/pkg.generated.mbti:42` exposes `#alias(write_stringview, deprecated)` without an accompanying symbol; it is unclear what it aliases, which can confuse consumers and tooling that expect a concrete target.
- `buffer/pkg.generated.mbti:55` exports `pub typealias Buffer as T`, but the single-letter alias adds little value while increasing collision risk with local type parameters named `T`.

**Assessment**
- Constructors (`from_array`, `from_bytes`, `from_iter`, `new`) give good coverage for common sources, and the write API is consistent across byte, numeric, and UTF encodings.
- `write_object(Self, &Show)` complements the rich set of primitives, ensuring any `Show` implementer can be serialized.

**Suggestions**
1. Replace the deprecated alias with either a clearly documented wrapper function or remove it if the old entry point is no longer supported.
2. Drop or rename the `T` alias unless there is a strong compatibility requirement; consider a more descriptive name if an alias must remain.
