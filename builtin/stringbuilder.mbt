/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit

/// Writes a StringView to the StringBuilder.
/// 
/// This is more efficient than converting the StringView to a String first,
/// as it directly writes the viewed portion without creating intermediate strings.
/// 
/// Parameters:
///
/// * `self` : The StringBuilder to write to.
/// * `view` : The StringView to write.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit
///   let sb = StringBuilder::new()
///   let str = "Hello, world!"
///   let view = str[7:12]  // "world"
///   sb.write_stringview(view)
///   assert_eq(sb.to_string(), "world")
/// ```
